KNOWN BUGS (if any):
  I seem to not getting the correct performance on test 12 on the grading server.
  On my VM, I consistenly run test 12 at about 1.5x stdio but it seems to time out
  the grading server.  Please run my code locally if this keeps happening. 


NOTES FOR THE GRADER (if any):
  I would have liked to use more than one cache during my write phase but was unable
  to mmap with a writeonly file.  I also did not see that much of a performance increase
  when I started mmaping the read only file but I may have been doing something
  incorrectly.
